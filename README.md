# Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem

Languages Used : C++
C++ STL not used. Used a self implemented generic stack

**Problem:**

**Statement:**Designed a generic calculator that takes as input an expression and evaluates as outputs the answer.

**Terminology** : Generic stack= A single expression can contain both int,double and the answer should be accordingly.

Example: 
- Input : (4+5)/6*3      Output : 4.
- Input: (4+5.6)/3.2+(4+3.888)     Output: 10.

**Operations to be implemented:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Modulo
